Then $X \\backslash \\bigcup_n A_n = \\bigcap_n (X \\backslash A_n)$ where $n$ ranges from 2 to $N$ and $A_1, \\dots, A_N$ are sets \n Proof: \n Let $P(N)$ be the proposition $X \\backslash \\bigcup_n A_n = \\bigcap_n (X \\backslash A_n)$ where $n$ ranges from 2 to $N$. \n Then $P(2)$ forms the base case and, by De Morgan's Laws, has already been proven. \n Suppose that the $P(N)$ holds and suppose $n$ ranges from 2 to $N + 1$. \n Then it follows that $X \\backslash \\bigcup_n^{N + 1} A_n = X \\backslash (\\bigcup_n^N A_n \\cup A_{N + 1})$. \n Using the $P(2)$ case this implies $X \\backslash \\bigcup_n^{N + 1} A_n = (X \\backslash \\bigcup_n^N A_n) \\cap (X \\backslash A_{N + 1}). \n Then using the induction hypothesis $X \\backslash \\bigcup_n^N A_n = \\bigcap_n^N (X \\backslash A_n)$. \n Hence, this implies $X \\backslash \\bigcup_n^{N + 1} A_n = \\bigcap_n^N (X \\backslash A_n) \\cap (X \\backslash A_{N + 1}) = \\bigcap_n^{N + 1} (X \\backslash A_n)$. \n Therefore as $P(N)$ implies $P(N + 1)$, by induction the proposition holds true.
